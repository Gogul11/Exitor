# Exitor - XV6 Text Editor (Vim-like)

This project implements a simple text editor within the xv6 operating system, inspired by the functionality of the `vim` editor. It introduces a dual-mode interface, allowing users to interact with files using **Insert Mode** and **Command Mode**.

## Features

- **Dual Modes:**
  - **Insert Mode**: Type and edit text in the file.
  - **Command Mode**: Navigate, save, and perform commands.
- **Basic Editing Capabilities**:
  - Insert text
  - Delete text
- **Clipboard Support**:
  - Copy and paste text within the editor

## How It Works

- On launching the editor, it starts in **Command Mode**.
- Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode** to start editing the text.
- In **Insert Mode**, all keystrokes are treated as file input.
- Press `ESC` to return to **Command Mode**.
- From **Command Mode**, you can:
  - Press `:w` to save the file.
  - Press `:q` to quit the editor.
  - Press `:wq` to save and quit.
  - Use commands to :y and specify lines for copying and :p to paste selected text.

## Building & Running

1. Clone the xv6 repo with this project included or add the editor code to your xv6 source.
2. Rebuild xv6:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make qemu
